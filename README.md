# Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization
DAO where stakeholders can vote on proposals, and the organization's governance and decision-making processes are entirely decentralized.

__Explanation:__

The contract defines a Proposal struct to store information about each proposal, including its unique proposal ID, proposer's address, description, creation time, votes for, votes against, status, and a mapping to track whether an address has voted.

The contract owner can create a new proposal using the createProposal function. Each proposal has a voting period defined during contract deployment.

Stakeholders can vote on proposals using the vote function. They can either vote in favor or against a proposal.

The contract uses the finalizeProposal function to determine the outcome of a proposal once the voting period ends. If the number of votes in favor exceeds the minimum required votes, the proposal is marked as approved. Otherwise, it is rejected.

The contract owner can set the voting period and the minimum votes required for a proposal to pass using the setVotingPeriod and setMinVotesRequired functions, respectively.

Please note that this is a simplified version, and a real-world Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) would require additional features, such as role-based access control, more sophisticated voting mechanisms (e.g., quadratic voting), and fund management logic based on approved proposals. Additionally, ensure you handle sensitive data and access control carefully to protect the governance process. Always conduct thorough testing and ensure security before deploying smart contracts in a production environment.

Interact with the Smart Contract:

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the provided functions. In Remix, go to the "Deployed Contracts" section to see the deployed contract. You can expand the contract and use the available functions to create proposals, vote on proposals, and finalize proposals.
Customize Parameters:

During contract deployment, you can customize the votingPeriod and minVotesRequired parameters according to your DAO's specific requirements.
Test the Smart Contract:

Thoroughly test the smart contract to ensure that proposal submission, voting, and fund management functionalities work as intended. In Remix, you can use the "Solidity Unit Testing" tab to write and run tests.
